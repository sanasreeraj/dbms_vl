                Data is stored in files and directories without a predefined structure.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are no relationships between different files. For instance, in a file system, you might have a <strong>customer_data.txt</strong> file and an <strong>orders_data.txt</strong> file, but the system does not automatically link customers to their orders.
              </li>
              <li>
                High risk of data redundancy: the same data might be stored in multiple files. For example, the customerâ€™s name and address might be repeated in several order records.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lacks advanced security, integrity, and concurrency control mechanisms. A file system might not restrict access to certain files.

                Data is stored in structured tables, often related to each other.

              <li>
                It enforces data integrity and consistency, ensuring that data is stored logically and without redundancy. For example, an <strong>orders</strong> table can reference a <strong>customers</strong> table, ensuring that no customer information is repeated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Supports complex queries and joins, allowing users to access and manipulate data across tables easily. For instance, a user could query for all orders made by a particular customer in a single SQL query.
              </li>
              <li>
                DBMS is optimized for multi-user access and transactions, preventing data corruption from simultaneous updates.

                Provides security features such as user roles, passwords, and encryption to protect sensitive data.
